        "In this assignment, you will explore the different fairness metrics learnt in class using a dataset of your choice. Before beginning, you will have to inspect the data and determine the variable of interest (i.e. the outcome) and at least two sensitive features. After each step of your analysis, you will write an in-depth analysis of your results.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook has four stages in which we will:\n",
        "1. Import the data, implement a few pre-processing steps, and inspect the data\n",
        "2. Run a short exploratory analysis of the primary variable of interest of your dataset\n",
        "3. Reproduce the logistic regression model  and interpret the estimates\n",
        "4. Compute the predictive accuracy of the risk score labels\n",
        "\n",
        "### Instructions\n",
        "- **Collaboration**: For assignments, you will submit ONE notebook per group.  The collaboration policy for the assignments is Full Collaboration. You may work with other students as permitted and you must identify your partners. All sources of information used including books, websites, students you talked to, must be cited in the submission.  Please see the course FAQ document for details on this collaboration policy.  We will adhere to current Faculty of Science guidelines on dealing with suspected cases of plagiarism.\n",
        "- **Group Work**: The assignments can be completed in groups of two. If you choose to complete an assignment as a group of two, both members of the group must submit a notebook file on canvas by the deadline. Everyone must include the names of all group members in the header of the submitted assignment.\n",
        "Software: We highly recommend that students use Google Colab for completing labs and assignments. This is the software used by the TAs in the course, and we can guarantee that there will be no issues with incompatible environments or imports.\n",
        "- **Filling out the Notebook**: You must use this notebook to complete your assignment. You will execute the questions in the notebook. The questions might ask for a short answer in text form or for you to write and execute a piece of code. Make sure you enter your answer in either case only in the cell provided.\n",
        "- **Important**:  Do not use a different cell, do not delete cells, and do not create a new cell. Creating new cells for your code is not compatible with the auto-grading system we are using and thus your assignment will not get grading properly and you will lose marks for that question. As a reminder you must remove the raise NotImplementedError() statements from each question when answering.\n",
        "- **Rules for Datasets**: Any datasets used in the assignment cannot be imported from cloud storage, e.g google drive, and must be read from a file either on your local computer or uploaded to the google colab notebook. Importing from cloud storage will result in a zero.\n",
        "- **Submission Formatting**: When you are done, you will submit your work from the notebook. Make sure to save your notebook before running it, and then submit on Canvas the notebook file with your work completed. Name your file with your Student ID number, followed by an underscore and A plus the assignment number (ex: 1234567_A2.ipynb). Failure to do so will result in your final score being reduced by 50%! Finally your name must be written at the top of the assignment document."

Note that your data may not be already filtered, so there may be rows that are not needed or missing values (NaN).  In your pre-processing, first retain only relevant columns for ease of analysis and inspection.  Relevant columns are those that you will need for analysis in this assignment - please read the whole assignment once over to determine which columns to retain. You will need to retain all columns with sensitive features, the output columns, and other columns that contain features needed for the analysis. Once you've retained the columns you want, remove the rows that are missing data (if needed).  \n",

        "The two plots show a clear difference in loan approval rates based on marital status. Married applicants have a 100% approval rate, meaning none were denied, while single applicants have a much higher denial rate, with more than half of their applications being rejected. The loan status (variable of interest) is not evenly distributed across marital status (second sensitive feature), as married applicants are significantly more likely to be approved compared to single applicants. This suggests that marital status may strongly influence loan decisions and potentially indicate a systematic bias in favor of married applicants."
