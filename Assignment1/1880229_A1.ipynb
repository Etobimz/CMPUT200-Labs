    "1. Understand and implement randomized response on binary data;\n",

    "- **Collaboration**: You may choose to work alone or in a group of two. If you choose to work with a partner, you must keep the same partner for both assignments.\n",
    "If you work with a partner, your submission must be the work of your team, and both of you should submit on Canvas. If you work alone, you must submit your own work.\n",
    "The collaboration policy for the assignments is a variation Consultation Collaboration. Under this policy, you may verbally discuss concepts with your classmates, without exchanging written text, code, or detailed advice. You must develop your own solution and submit your own work (as a group or individually). All sources of information used, including books, websites, and students you talked to, must be cited in the submission. We will adhere to current Faculty of Science guidelines on dealing with suspected cases of plagiarism.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Software**: We highly recommend that students use Google Colab for completing labs and assignments. This is the software used by the TAs in the course, and we can guarantee that there will be no issues with incompatible environments or imports.\n",
    "- **Filling out the Notebook**: You must use this notebook to complete your lab. You will execute the questions in the notebook. The questions might ask for a short answer in text form or for you to write and execute a piece of code. Make sure you enter your answer in either case only in the cell provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Important**:  Do not use a different cell, do not delete cells, and do not create a new cell. Creating new cells for your code is not compatible with the auto-grading system we are using and thus your assignment will not get grading properly and you will lose marks for that question. As a reminder you must remove the raise NotImplementedError() statements from each question when answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rules for Datasets**: Any datasets used in the lab cannot be imported from cloud storage, e.g google drive, and must be read from a file either on your local computer or uploaded to the google collab notebook. Importing from cloud storage will result in a zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Submission Formatting**: When you are done, you will submit your work from the notebook. Make sure to save your notebook before running it, and then submit on Canvas the notebook file with your work completed. Name your file with your Student ID number, followed by an underscore and A plus the assignment number (ex: 1234567_A1.ipynb). Failure to do so will result in your final score being reduced by 50%! Finally your name must be written at the top of the lab or assignment document."
